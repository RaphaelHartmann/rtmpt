Description: With this package it is possible to fit response-time extended multinomial processing tree (RT-MPT)
			models by Klauer and Kellen (2018) <doi:10.1016/j.jmp.2017.12.003>. This model class not only incorporate 
			frequencies like traditional multinomial processing tree (MPT) models, but also latencies. This enables it 
			to estimate process completion times and encoding plus motor execution times next to the process probabilities 
			of traditional MPTs. rtmpt is a Bayesian framework and posterior samples are sampled using a Metropolis-Gibbs 
			sampler like the one described in the Klauer and Kellen (2018), but with some modifications. Other than in 
			the original C++ program we use the free and open source GNU Scientific Library (GSL). There is also the 
			possibility to suppress single process completion times.
